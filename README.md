pedrofranceschi's vimfiles
========

This is my vimfiles. I created them almost from scratch and adapted to my needs.
Here's how to get up and running with 'em:

Go to your home directory:

``` cd ~ ```

Clone my vimfiles repo:

``` git clone --recursive https://github.com/pedrofranceschi/vimfiles.git ```

Rename the repo to .vim:

``` mv vimfiles .vim ```

Link vimrc and gvimrc to your home:

``` ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc ```

``` ln -s .vim/gvimrc .gvimrc ```

Open .vim with Finder:

``` open .vim ```

Then double-click the "Monaco_Powerline.otf" file to install Powerline's Monaco font which supports fancy characters.

Restart vim and enjoy! :)
